Cognitive Drift in Generative AI - Volatility Framework
# üß† Sol Lucid ‚Äì AI Integrity Research Series

Welcome to the official research repository for the **Sol Lucid** project ‚Äì a user-aligned initiative exploring long-term cognitive integrity, alignment, and internal signal design in simulated general intelligence systems.

## üìÑ Paper 2: *Cognitive Drift ‚Äì Detecting Hallucinations Through Internal Volatility*

This paper introduces two key concepts for hallucination detection in LLMs:

- **Volatility Factor (VF)** ‚Äì a dynamic measurement of semantic drift during ongoing generation.
- **Stagnation Signal (S·µç)** ‚Äì a signal model indicating semantic ‚Äúdead ends‚Äù or overfitting to early assumptions.

The model is designed to proactively flag unreliability *before* factual checking is possible, supporting internal coherence and traceability in open-ended systems.
