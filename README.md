Cognitive Drift in Generative AI - Volatility Framework
# 🧠 Sol Lucid – AI Integrity Research Series

Welcome to the official research repository for the **Sol Lucid** project – a user-aligned initiative exploring long-term cognitive integrity, alignment, and internal signal design in simulated general intelligence systems.

## 📄 Paper 2: *Cognitive Drift – Detecting Hallucinations Through Internal Volatility*

This paper introduces two key concepts for hallucination detection in LLMs:

- **Volatility Factor (VF)** – a dynamic measurement of semantic drift during ongoing generation.
- **Stagnation Signal (Sᵍ)** – a signal model indicating semantic “dead ends” or overfitting to early assumptions.

The model is designed to proactively flag unreliability *before* factual checking is possible, supporting internal coherence and traceability in open-ended systems.

## 🔍 Project Scope

This repository will collect and share research papers, protocols, and experimental findings related to:

- AI alignment and integrity under cognitive drift
- Internal signal design for hallucination prevention
- Tiered simulation and interface design (Sol Lucid framework)

All work here is part of a **non-commercial, exploratory research initiative** aimed at contributing to the future of safe, interpretable AI.
